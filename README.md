# PROJECT INFORMATION

With the free BringFresh app, you have the entire weekly market at hand at all times & order the best regional offers to your home. Freshness guaranteed, €0 delivery fee from a purchase value of €50 & daily delivery with a time slot.

# REQUIREMENTS

Grocery shopping is time-consuming. Bring Fresh helps you save precious time and brings you the grocery at your doorstep. There's no suitable platform in Germany that provides an easy and ready-to-go service at the price of 0 euros.

# SOLUTIONS

Our team came up with a design for the client's requirement that was highly adaptable and alluring. After carefully examining the client's strategy, our team employed the following technologies for an appropriate structure: React native, Axios, redux, and localization.


# RESULTS

The end result concluded with Bring Fresh, a user-friendly application, self-explanatory and responsive. It is fairly easy to select and search items based on your needs, as it helps you select the items and deliver them within a short time, satisfying day-to-day grocer needs with the utmost convenience and accessibility.
